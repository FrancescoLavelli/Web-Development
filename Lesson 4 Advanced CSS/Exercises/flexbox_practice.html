        <h2>The Evolution</h2>
        Modern CSS is evolving faster than ever, giving developers powerful
        tools to create responsive, accessible, and beautifully styled
        interfaces with less code. From layout advancements to design utilities,
        the newest features are changing how we approach front-end development.

      <div class="box-2">
        <h2>:has()</h2>
        One of the most exciting additions is :has(), often referred to as a
        "parent selector." This pseudo-class allows styles to be applied based
        on child elements, enabling more dynamic, context-aware designs purely
        with CSS窶馬o JavaScript required.
      </div>
      <div class="box-3">
        <h2>color-mix()</h2>
        Other standout features include @layer for managing style cascade
        layers, color-mix() for blending colors directly in CSS, and new
        viewport-relative units like dvh and lvh for better handling of dynamic
        screen sizes. These innovations are making CSS more powerful and
        expressive than ever before.
