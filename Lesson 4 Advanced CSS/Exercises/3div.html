    <h1>Exploring the Latest and Greatest in CSS</h1>
    <div class="box">
      Modern CSS is evolving faster than ever, giving developers powerful tools
      to create responsive, accessible, and beautifully styled interfaces with
      less code. From layout advancements to design utilities, the newest
      features are changing how we approach front-end development.

      One of the most exciting additions is :has(), often referred to as a
      "parent selector." This pseudo-class allows styles to be applied based on
      child elements, enabling more dynamic, context-aware designs purely with
      CSSâ€”no JavaScript required.

      Other standout features include @layer for managing style cascade layers,
      color-mix() for blending colors directly in CSS, and new viewport-relative
      units like dvh and lvh for better handling of dynamic screen sizes. These
      innovations are making CSS more powerful and expressive than ever before.
